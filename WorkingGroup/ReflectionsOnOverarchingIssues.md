# General Open Overarching :

* A combined open/protected data policy? Or, two separate policies?
- Yes, this seems right.

* Do we need a separate internal policy document to govern use of data in a more fine-grained way?
There should be higher and lower level rules and processes generally and likely at lower levels differing guidance depending on the context (eg health data, student data, police data, etc).  Some governance issues should probably be developed that are reusable at higher levels and large clusters (eg: health and education) but lower level governance and especially management or procedures at the lowest levels of implementation. 

* When/how to best engage other departments in crafting this policy?
* When/how to best engage the public in crafting this policy?
* Ongoing governance structure for modifying/revising policy?
